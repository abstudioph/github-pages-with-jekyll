Well, this is my first blog on Github pages. 
Did not quite get it the first time, I was getting ahead of the instuctions. 
Nevertheless, I learned something new today. Actually, quite a lot! I used Github when I worked as a QA Tester years ago but did not really went through this kind of training. I am glad these resources are available for free. It is a big help for people like me who are new to coding and who need tools such as this.

Thank you Github Training Team! You're awesome!
